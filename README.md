# yaptide backend

## Getting the code

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yaptide/yaptide.git
```

## Building and running the app

There are two main ways of build and run the app
- [For developers](https://yaptide.github.io/for_developers/backend/for_developers/), which is setting up all components manually. It is faster then Docker.
- [Using Docker](https://yaptide.github.io/for_developers/backend/using_docker/). Used for the deployment, takes more time.
