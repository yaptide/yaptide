# yaptide backend

## Getting the code

Clone the repository:

```shell
git cloneF https://github.com/yaptide/yaptide.git
```

## Building and running the app

There are two main ways of build and run the app
- [For developers](./docs/for_developers.md), which is setting up all components manually. It is faster then Docker.
- [Using Docker](./docs/using_docker.md). Used for the deployment, takes more time.
