# JSON files types

We have 3 types of JSON files:

1. **Project JSON** - file that could be generated using UI and saved using "Save project" button
   - Examples of such files are in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/yaptide/ui/tree/master/src/ThreeEditor/examples) or in `yaptide_tester/example.json`
   - This file can contain only simulation input in JSON format or results as well
   - Top-level keys: "metadata", "project", "scene", and others...

2. **Payload JSON** - object which is sent to the server using POST request from UI
   - All such objects contain "input_files" or "input_json" top-level key
     - a) **Editor Payload JSON** type assumes that the user defined the simulation using UI 3D Editor and selected it for running
       - Examples of such files are in `tests/res/json_payload_editor.json`
       - Inside "input_json" key, we have the contents of the project JSON file
     - b) **Files Payload JSON** type assumes that the user uploaded input files and selected them for running
       - Examples of such files are in `tests/res/json_payload_files.json`
       - Inside "input_files" key, we have a dictionary with filenames as keys and contents of input files as values

We assume the following conventions: `editor_dict`, `payload_editor_dict`, `payload_files_dict`, and `payload_dict`

- `editor_dict['metadata']`, `editor_dict['scene']` is always valid
- `editor_dict['input_type']` is not valid

`payload_dict` can be either `payload_editor_dict` or `payload_files_dict`
- `payload_dict['input_type']` is always valid

Therefore, `payload_editor_dict['input_json']` can be passed as `editor_dict`
- `payload_editor_dict['input_json']['metadata']` is valid
- `payload_editor_dict['input_json']['scene']` is valid
- `payload_editor_dict['input_json']['beam.dat']` is not valid
- `payload_editor_dict['input_files']['beam.dat']` is not valid

Therefore, for `payload_files_dict['input_files']`
- `payload_files_dict['input_files']['metadata']` is not valid
- `payload_files_dict['input_files']['beam.dat']` is valid
- `payload_editor_dict['input_json']['metadata']` is not valid

We also have `files_dict` where keys are filenames and values are contents of input files
- `files_dict[beam.dat]` is valid

# Testing resources

The testing resources are obtained from the web interface by loading first example (called "Proton pencil beam in water") and submitting such simulation to the backend. The files should captured via developer console in the browser. We aim in the tests to check how backend behaves when processing real files as being sent by the frontend part.

 1. `json_payload_editor.json` is captured when user selects simulation to run from the editor window (selecting 4 workers)
 2. `json_payload_files.json` is captured when user selects simulation to run from the input files window (selecting 4 workers)
 3.  `json_with_results.json` is captured when user selects simulation to run from the editor window (selecting 4 workers) and the simulation is finished
