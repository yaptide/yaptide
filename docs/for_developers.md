# For developers

Project make use of poetry for dependency management. If you do not have it installed, check official [poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
Project is configured to  create virtual environment for you, so you do not need to worry about it.
Virtual environment is created in `.venv` folder in the root of the project.

## Installing dependencies

To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all the dependencies including `test` and `docs` ones.
If you want to test app, you do not need `docs` dependencies, you can skip them by using:

```bash
poetry install --without docs
```

If you want to install only main dependencies, you can use:

```bash
poetry  install --only main,test
```
(There can't be space after comma in above command)

## Building and running the app

Application consists of multiple components. Following instruction will guide you through the process of set up and running the application.

Here is a flowchart that shows the various dependencies between the different components of the application.

```

1. Download SHIELD-HIT12A simulator

    Currently, we store binaries of simulators on S3 filesystem. SHIELD-HIT12A (full version) and Fluka files are encrypted.

    To simply init download process we have to run following commands:

    === "Linux"

        ```bash
        poetry run yaptide/admin/simulators.py download-shieldhit --dir bin
        ```

    === "Windows (PowerShell)"

        ```powershell
        poetry run yaptide\admin\simulators.py download-shieldhit --dir bin
        ```

    To get full instruction of command usage we can type

    === "Linux"

        ```bash
        poetry run yaptide/admin/simulators.py
        ```

    === "Windows (PowerShell)"

        ```powershell
        poetry run yaptide\admin\simulators.py
        ```


2. Get the redis
    If you already use it just start it on port `6379`

    If not good solution would comes with help of docker, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    docker run --detach --publish 6379:6379 --name yaptide_redis redis:7-alpine
    ```

    To remove this container use:

    ```bash
    docker rm -f yaptide_redis
    ```

3. Run Celery simulation-worker

    You can reuse the same terminal, as for redis, as docker sends redis process to the background

    === "Linux"

        ```bash
        PATH=$PATH:bin BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000 CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 poetry run celery --app yaptide.celery.simulation_worker worker --events -P eventlet --hostname yaptide-simulation-worker --queues simulations --loglevel=debug
        ```

    === "Windows (PowerShell)"

        ```powershell
        $Env:PATH += ";" + (Join-Path -Path (Get-Location) -ChildPath "bin"); $env:BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5000"; $env:CELERY_BROKER_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"; $env:CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"; poetry run celery --app yaptide.celery.simulation_worker worker --events -P eventlet --hostname yaptide-simulation-worker --queues simulations --loglevel=debug
        ```


4. Run Celery helper-worker

    === "Linux"

    ```bash
    PATH=$PATH:bin FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///db.sqlite BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000 CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 poetry run celery --app yaptide.utils.helper_worker worker --events --hostname yaptide-helper-worker --queues helper --loglevel=debug
    ```

    === "Windows (PowerShell)"
    ```powershell
    $Env:PATH += ";" + (Join-Path -Path (Get-Location) -ChildPath "bin"); $env:FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///db.sqlite"; $env:BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5000"; $env:CELERY_BROKER_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"; $env:CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"; poetry run celery --app yaptide.utils.helper_worker worker --events --hostname yaptide-helper-worker --queues helper --loglevel=debug
    ```


5. Run the app

    === "Linux"

        ```bash
        FLASK_USE_CORS=True FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///db.sqlite" CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 poetry run flask --app yaptide.application run
        ```

    === "Windows (PowerShell)"

        ```powershell
        $env:FLASK_USE_CORS="True"; $env:FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///db.sqlite"; $env:CELERY_BROKER_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"; $env:CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"; poetry run flask --app yaptide.application run
        ```


    This command will create `db.sqlite` inside `./instance` folder. This is [default Flask behavior](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/config/#instance-folders).

    To get more debugging information you can also force SQLALCHEMY to use `echo` mode by setting `SQLALCHEMY_ECHO` environment variable to `True`.

    === "Linux"

        ```bash
        FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_ECHO=True FLASK_USE_CORS=True FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///db.sqlite" CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 poetry run flask --app yaptide.application run
        ```

    === "Windows (PowerShell)"

        ```powershell
        $env:FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_ECHO="True"; $env:FLASK_USE_CORS="True"; $env:FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///db.sqlite"; $env:CELERY_BROKER_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"; $env:CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"; poetry run flask --app yaptide.application run
        ```

    To include debugging messages from flask, add `--debug` option to the command.

    While running backend and frontend, developer may encounter [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) errors in web browser's console that prevent communication to the server. To resolve these CORS issues, one should set FLASK_USE_CORS=True in the `.env` file (notice that it's already included in above command).  Also pay attention if your frontend runs on ```http://127.0.0.1:3000``` or ```http://localhost:3000```, because right now cors_config in application.py specifies these URLs.


## Database

To add user, run:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///instance/db.sqlite" poetry run yaptide/admin/db_manage.py add-user admin --password password
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"

    ```powershell
    $env:FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///instance/db.sqlite"; poetry run yaptide\admin\db_manage.py add-user admin --password password
    ```

You can use the following command, to get more information:

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///instance/db.sqlite" poetry run yaptide/admin/db_manage.py --help
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"

    ```powershell
    $env:FLASK_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///instance/db.sqlite"; poetry run yaptide\admin\db_manage.py --help
    ```

## Testing

To run tests use:

=== "Linux"

    ```shell
    poetry run pytest
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"
    On Windows you need to run tests one by one:

    ```shell
    Get-ChildItem -Path "tests" -Filter "test_*.py" -Recurse | foreach { poetry run pytest $_.FullName }
    ```


## Development

To maintain code quality, we use yapf.
To avoid running it manually we strongly recommend to use pre-commit hooks. To install it run:

```shell
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Pre-commit Use Cases

- **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes using `git commit` in  terminal or using `GUI Git client` in your IDE.

### Case 1: All Hooks Pass Successfully

-  **Pre-commit Hooks Run**: Before the commit is finalized, pre-commit will automatically run all configured hooks. If all hooks pass without any issues, the commit proceeds as usual.

### Case 2: Some Hooks Fail

- **Pre-commit Hooks Run**: Before the commit is finalized, pre-commit will automatically run all configured hooks. If one or more hooks fail, pre-commit will abort the commit process.

   - **terminal** - all issues will be listed in terminal with `Failed` flag
   - **VS Code** - you will get error popup, click on `show command output` alle issues will be presented in the same way as they would appear in the terminal.

- **Fix Issues**: Address the issues reported by the failed hooks. Some hooks automatically format code so you don't have to change anything. Once the issues are fixed, commit once more.

### YAPF

Out main use of pre-comit is yapf which is Python code formatter that automatically formats Python code according to predefined style guidelines. We can specify styles for yapf in `[tool/yapf]` section of `pyproject.toml` file. The goal of using yapf is to always produce code that is following the chosen style guidelines.

### Running pre-commit manually

To manually run all pre-commit hooks on repository use:
```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```
If you wnat to run specific hook use:
```shell
pre-commit run <hook_id>
```
 Each `hook_id` tag is specified in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. It is recommended to use these commands after adding new hook to your config in order to check already existing files.

### Custom hooks

Pre-commit allows creating custom hooks by writing script in preffered language which is supported by pre-commit and adding it to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. In yaptide we use custom hook which checks for not empty env files. This hook prevents user from commiting and pushing to repository secrets such as passwords.
